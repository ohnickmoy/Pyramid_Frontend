Pyramid was my final project during my time at Flatiron School. This is the repo for frontend side of this project. It takes inspiritation from the [GZCL Linear Progression](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html) weightlifting program. Come check it out!

##  Motivations

Weightlifting has been one of my growing hobbies for a while now and this training program helped me get stronger pretty quickly when I was starting out. 

When I was mulling over project ideas, my gut instinct was work on a project that solved a problem that I was dealing with. Working with spreadsheets in the gym felt clunkie, so I took inspiritation from other gym apps to make a project that suited my needs 

One challenge, among many, was implementing the algorithm that followed the linear progression protocol based on a failed or successful execution of sets (like finishing 5 sets of Squats for 3 reps a piece) and determining the weight for the next time a user would do a certain routine. Differentiation of whether an exercise was a T1 or T2 was challenging, and that's explaining more in depth in my [backend repo](https://github.com/ohnickmoy/Pyramid_Backend)
